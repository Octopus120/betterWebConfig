I have been given {time} to speak, so make sure you come up with something that can be delivered within that time. I want you to create a list of slides that the presentation should contain. For each slide I want you to list the headline, other media (image/video/gif) and the speaker's notes as a list of bullet points. Each slide should contain no more than 30 words so they don't distract from what I'm saying. Each slide should only talk about one thing. It's better to have more slides saying less then less slides saying more. Slides can also contain images, charts, diagrams and films, if they help communicate a point clearly.\n{audience}:\n{action}:\n{time}:\n{text}:"],
