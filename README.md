### 4. Overview
Quickly input proper prompt using shortcut with hints

I type in more than 50 prompts every day on average. Most of the prompts and have similar contents. To improve productivity, I developed this Chrome extension, and glad to share it with large community.

This Chrome extension can automatically perform text expansion and complete with prompts below the curer, which will save your time dramatically.

Current version supports chatGPT, service-now, gmail, hotmail and yahoo email. It is fully tested using 126.0.6478.183 on Mac. Here are the major features: 

1 Doule click a ticket ID from MS Teams and Slack and find it in Service-Now

2 Shortcut to copy user ID, ticket ID, and others for pasting to other applications

3 Highlight visited tickets for the day, bookmark tickets for future visits

4 Shortcut to hide/show less informative web elements. This is good for iPhone's small screen

5 Add clickable links to tickets and answers

6 Auto-save draft after pause typing for 3 seconds

7 Shortcuts for common links and answers

8 Auto-complete sentences sent before

9 Shortcuts to fill out forms
